# Architectural Decision Records

Open Modular uses Architectural Decision Records to track key design and implementation decisions. See the [first decision record][0] for more information. If you're using Rust, the [`adrs`][1] tool is useful for creating, editing, etc. these records, and can be installed using `cargo`.
